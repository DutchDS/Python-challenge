Repository for Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

In order for the pyBank and pyPoll scripts to work
they need to be executed in a directory that holds the following folders:

Output
pyBank
pyPoll
Resources

Both python scripts will use Resources for their initial csv input file
Both python scripts will use the Output folder for their text output

As an extra challenge pyBoss was created as well. It needs us_states.py to be imported, therefor that file needs to reside alongside the main.py script in the pyBoss folder.

Lastly, pyParagraph was created.
