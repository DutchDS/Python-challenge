Repository for Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

The PyBank challenge delivers a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. A set of financial data called budget_data.csv is given. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll takes a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. This Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on the popular vote.


In order for the pyBank and pyPoll scripts to work they need to be executed in a directory that holds the following folders:

Output
pyBank
pyPoll
Resources

Both python scripts will use Resources for their initial csv input file
Both python scripts will use the Output folder for their text output

As an extra challenge pyBoss was created as well. It needs us_states.py to be imported, therefor that file needs to reside alongside the main.py script in the pyBoss folder.

Lastly, pyParagraph was created.
