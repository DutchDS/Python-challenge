Repository for Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

In order for the pyBank and pyPoll scripts to work
they need to be executed in a directory that holds the following folders:

Output
pyBank
pyPoll
Resources

Both python scripts will use Resources for their initial csv input file
Both python scripts will use the Output folder for their text output
